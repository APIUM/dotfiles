# dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles as of 13.03.16.

It started as a migration from my Dell Latitude E6100 to a Dell XPS 13 2016. The vast difference in screen resolution (1366x768 vs 3200x1800) nessesstated an update on a lot of my config, which in turn inspired me to make my desktop a touch more minimal and beautiful.

My key setup at the moment is i3wm with Lemonbar.

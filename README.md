# apium's dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles as of 13.03.16.

My key setup at the moment is i3wm with polybar. 

This is the slegestor branch, which is my desktop. Desktop is 2560*1440. 

The whole setup is managed by GNU Stow which is perfectly set up to manage dotfiles, I can't believe I didn't run into it sooner.
I used this [explaination](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) as a guide. I would havily reccommend the GNU Stow method for dotfile management.

# dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles as of 13.03.16.

My key setup at the moment is i3wm with Lemonbar. 

It started as a migration from my Dell Latitude E6100 to a Dell XPS 13 2016. The vast difference in screen resolution (1366x768 vs 3200x1800) nessesstated an update on a lot of my config, which in turn inspired me to make my desktop a touch more minimal and beautiful.

The whole setup is managed by GNU Stow which is perfectly set up to manage dotfiles, I can't believe I dind't run into it sooner.
I used this [explaination](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) as a guide. I would havily reccommend the GNU Stow method for dotfile management.
